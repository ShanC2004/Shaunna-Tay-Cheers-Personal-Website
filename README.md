      <h3>All About Me</h3>

<p>My name is Shaunna Tay. I am from a small town in Arkansas with a population of 14,000; I graduated high school in 2004 and started college shortly after. I have been married for sixteen years to the love of my life. We have a blended family with six amazing children. Our first grandchild was born in July 2023. Okay, that's enough about me.<p><br><br>

<h3>"My Life Goals"</h3>
<p>My goal is to become a software developer and land a job where I can gain more experience creating web pages with unique designs and layouts. The long-term goal is to become an entrepreneur.</p><br><br>

<h3>"My Journey In Becoming A Software Developer and What I Have Learned So Far"</h3>

<p>The journey began with applying for the class and getting accepted into the software developer program. So far, I have learned the meaning of the World Wide Web(www). The world wide web is the connection between the public and the Internet. Each server has a unique identifier called an IP address that works like a postal address. Computers that consume content or services are called clients. HTML is the language to create web pages. Markup language means it uses tags or markup to define and structure content. The markup language uses tags to control the structure, format, and relationships between a set of symbols. When creating a web page remember the first line of the file indicates to the browser that the page is written in HTML language: <!DOCTYPE html>  I have also learned how to change different tags, open and close paragraphs, add background colors, and images, make the table, add columns, and change the size of the table. This is what I have learned so far. I will be updating my web page with more information as a manevuer through the rest of the software development program. Stay Tuned!!!!.</p><br><br>
